# Ion Thrusters

Ion thrusters use beams of ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation. The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs take advantage of the charge/mass ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of reaction mass or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific power required compared to chemical rockets. Ion thrusters are therefore able to achieve high specific impulses. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes ion thrusters unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion.

The difference between ion propulsion and conventional propulsion is 
that in ion propulsion you are throwing little tiny amounts of stuff 
out the back at very high speeds but in conventional propulsion
you are throwing huge amounts of stuff out the back at a slower speed.

```
Force = Mass x Acceleration
Ion rocket: 
    Force = little tiny mass x BIG ACCELERATION
Normal rocket:
    Force = HUGE MASS x less acceleration
```
